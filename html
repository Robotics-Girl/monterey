  <h1> Monterey - FRC ROBOTICS COMPETITION </h1>
 <p>I had a robotics competition from March 29th-April 1st. I am part of the team of 6059 of FRC team at the Monterey Bay Regional. We sadly did not get an alliance or a good ranking. We got the ranking of 21/36. Even though we were very bad, it was still very fun. </p>

  <p>Besides, the competition, we were in Monterey, which was fun. At Monterey, there are a lot of beaches and amazing places to go. Some well known beaches in Monterey are the Carmel Beach and San Carlos Beach.</p>
